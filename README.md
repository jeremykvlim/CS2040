# CS2040

Lab assignments for CS2040 taken in AY2022/2023 S1, taught by Prof Tan Sun Teck.

On a weekly basis, 3 lab problems were given and labelled A, B, C in increasing difficulty (week 0 and week 9 are exceptions, being the introductory week and practical exam week respectively). The B problems were to be submitted and graded. PDFs for all problems, .in and .out test case files and my Java solutions are attached. A shell script (check.sh) is attached for every assignment and can be run to verify that the solution passes all test cases.

The hardest labs in my opinion were School (7C) and Robot (11C). The difficulty lies in making a solution that is fast enough to pass CodeCrunch's hidden test cases. However, I don't have access to that, so you'll just have to take my word for it that I cleared everything.

Code was written a while ago and a lot of it was for personal comfort as most of the labs are not graded, so do bare with the laziness.
